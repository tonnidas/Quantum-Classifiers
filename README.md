### (A) The whole project can be divided into two segment as following:
1. Implementation of Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm
2. Implementation of 4 quantum-classifiers
    1. SVC with **Quantum** kernal, 
    2. QSVC (**Quantum** support vector machine), 
    3. CircuitQNN classifier (Circuit **Quantum** neural network), 
    4. VQC (Variational **Quantum** classifier)
    
on four datasets named as dataset1 (of size 100 and linearly separable), dataset2 (of size 100 and linearly semi-separable), dataset3 (of size 200 and linearly separable), dataset4 (of size 200 and linearly semi-separable)

### (B) The code for the four quantum-classifier in in this file "Quantum_Classification.ipynb" of this Quantum-Classifier repository
### (C) The code for the bernstain-Vajirani algorithm is in "Bernstein_Vazirani_Algorithm.ipynb" of this Quantum-Classifier repository
### (D) The project paper is named as A_case_study_with_Quantum_Classifier_and_Bernstein_Vazirani_Algorithm.pdf in this Quantum-Classifier repository
